# TrackRelay 🏃‍♂️💨

**TrackRelay** is a Python-based analytics tool designed to help school track teams digitize their performance data and optimize relay team selection.

## 📌 Project Overview
As a 3-time relay runner, I noticed that most athletic data in school is tracked manually. This project aims to:
- Calculate individual athlete speeds and paces.
- Analyze team splits for 4x100m and 4x400m relays.
- Predict target times for future performance goals.

## 🚀 Current Features
- **Performance Calculator:** Logic for speed and pace assessment.
- **Team Reports:** A system to log and average relay splits.
- **Goal Setter:** Predictive modeling for improvement targets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **In-Progress:** Integration with Streamlit for a web-based dashboard.

## 📈 MIT Goal
I am building this project as part of my journey to study Computer Science at MIT. It serves as a practical application of the concepts I am learning in **Harvard's CS50P**.
